Welcome to my personal website! This serves as a platform for me to write about my various projects and to host my CTF writeups!

A little about my academic and professional experience:
 
I have a BSc in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia. My early years at university were focused on Physics, Astronomy, Math and Atmospheric Science. I later transitioned to Computer Science when I figured out how much I liked it.

I have experience in academic research and in startups developing backend systems that required high availability/reliability. 

I also spent 2 years competing with and establishing the UBC CTF Team. This experience gave me the opportunity to dive deep into the complexities of computer systems and to share in that learning experience with a community of passionate people. As I learned more, I took to teaching in order to pass on my knowledge to newer members.

During university, I got sucked into the worlds of rock climbing, mountaineering, slacklining, and even a little paragliding.
 
Rock climbing was my biggest... let's say passion... in my personal life. It was very addictive for some reason. I think the spatial/bodily problem solving aspect of rock climbing was something that I particularly loved. Efficient placement of my center of mass and strategic motions greatly exceeded brute strength in my experience. In conjunction with the intense fear of barely holding onto the cliff as I climbed and the subsequent epic feeling of achievement, it was truly unlike anything else.
 
Unfortunately, because I was so in love with climbing, I did it way too much and I was too concerned with progressing and getting better, that I gave myself too many tendon and muscle strains, until I eventually realized that I couldn't do it anymore at that intensity. To this day I'm still working on adjusting my approach and rehabilitating the injuries.

Slacklining was also something that intrigued me intensely. Specifically, slacklining very high above the ground, what we call "highlining".
 
The friends I met through these activities are all people I greatly cherish. Such wonderful communities of people.
 
I was also lucky that there was usually someone around with a camera :) Otherwise there would be no evidence!
